# Sandbox

This repository is designed to allow projects seeking to join the CNCF as a :package: Sandbox :package: project to submit their applications. It is still a work in progress and we welcome PRs on this repo to automate assignments, improve the process, etc.  If you have any questions, please reach out in the [TOC Slack Channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0MP69YF4) or file and [issue()] on the repo.

For information on the sandbox process please check out the [details on our sandbox process on the main project process page](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/project_proposals.md#sandbox-process).

## How to apply

Applying is as easy as 1-2-3!

1. Open a new [Sandbox Application]() using the linked issue form. 
1. Complete all sections of the form.
1. Submit the issue.

## What's next?

Your project's application is placed in the backlog for triaging. You can view the status of your application and others at anytime by checking out our [Project Board]().

When the TOC meets to review applications, more details on [frequency here](), your issue will be pulled up and discussed. Your application may receive one of several statuses:
* `New` - It is a brand new application and is in the backlog for an upcoming review.
* `Approved` - The application has been reviewed and been approved by the TOC. The issue will be closed.
* `Declined` - The application has been reviewed and been declined by the TOC. The comments on the issue will reflect the TOC decision and the issue will be closed.
* `Need-Info` - The application has been reviewed and requires more information in order for the TOC to further discuss the application.  For instructions on what to do, please jump down to [Need-Info](#Need-Info).
* `Assign-TAG` - The application has been reviewed and the TOC would like a TAG to review or consult with the project prior to further discussions.  For instructions on what to do, please jump down to [Assign-TAG](#Assign-TAG).
* `Returning` - The application has been reviewed previously, was affixed a `Need-Info` or `Assign-TAG` label, and that work has been completed and is ready for re-review.  For instructions on what to do, please jump down to [Returning](#Returning).

### Need Info

If your project is assigned a `Need-Info` label, the TOC will comment on the issue with the specific additional information needed.  It will then be placed in the `Waiting` status of the [Project Board]().

Please provide the additional information requested as a comment on the issue. Once you have done this, **remove the `Need-Info` label and affix the `Returning` label**, this lets the TOC know it is ready to be reviewed again. It will then be removed from the `Waiting` status and placed in the `Upcoming` status for discussion at the next meeting.

### Assign TAG

If your project is assigned an `Assign-TAG` label, the TOC will comment which TAG(s) and provide specific details on what is requested. The TAG Co-Chair(s) will be assigned the issue. Depending on the details of the comment, the TAG or the project will update the issue with a comment containing any pertinent information. This may include links to a presentation recording, as summary of a discussion with the TAG, or recommendations.

Once a comment has been added,  **remove the `Assign-TAG` label and affix the `Returning` label**, this lets the TOC know it is ready to be reviewed again. It will then be removed from the `Waiting` status and placed in the `Upcoming` status for discussion at the next meeting.

#### TAG(s)

If the issue

### Returning
